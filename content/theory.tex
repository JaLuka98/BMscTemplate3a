This is an example for a citation:
The Higgs boson, discovered by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012~\cite{ATLAS:2012yve,CMS:2012qbp}, is the only elementary scalar boson in the standard model.

Particle detectors are very nice~\cite{Kolanoski:2016gyf}.

PhD students at RWTH Aachen University have produced some nice theses in the past~\cite{Rieger:2019rgc}.

CMS releases some nice results for conferences~\cite{CMS-PAS-SMP-22-009}.

Theoreticians also release nice, thick summary documents~\cite{LHCHiggsCrossSectionWorkingGroup:2016ypw}.

You can also cite websites~\cite{Guardian}, although you should usually refer to trusted scientific articles and books\dots
