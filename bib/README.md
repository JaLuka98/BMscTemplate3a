# References

## Formatting

By default, the pages are added to references of type 'article' in the bibliography. You can suppress this by 'x-ing' the pages: Simply rename the 'pages' field to 'xpages' and it will be ignored. An example can be found in the entries `ATLAS:2012yve` and `CMS:2012qbp` in `bib/experimental.bib`.

By default, the month is added to the year if present. We recommend to suppress this by `x-ing` the 'month' field as also recommended for the pages.
