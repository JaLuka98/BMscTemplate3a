# BMscTemplate3a

Based on work by Marcel Rieger: https://gitlab.cern.ch/aachen-3a-cms/thesis-template

## TODO

- Mention \newcommand{\bindcorrection}{no} (thesis.tex) (for printing vs just uploading a PDF)

- Indent everything correctly with spaces instead of tabs

- Document eidesstattliche Versicherung: Fill in with PDF viewer, then print, sign, and upload

- Document pageshift and newpage (index.tex): Always fill to even/odd pages for new section or just begin on the next page

- Mention that it is optional to include the doi, can be x-ed

- Briefly mention how to get references from inspire

- Check if "website" and "software" can be cited correctly

- Why does phdthesis not work even though it is defined in cms_unsrt.bst? Unclear to JLS.
